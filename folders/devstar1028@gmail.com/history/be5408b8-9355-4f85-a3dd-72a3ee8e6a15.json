It involves the use of statistical techniques to enable machines to automatically learn from and analyze large amounts of data, identify patterns, and make accurate predictions or decisions. Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, depending on the type of data and the learning approach used."

In other words, it is a method of teaching computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. Machine learning algorithms can analyze and interpret large amounts of data, identify patterns, and make predictions or take actions based on those patterns. This technology is widely used in various fields, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles."
